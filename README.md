# Shutdowns
This project is related to an APP which enables all the employees in a Electricity Supply and Generation Company to keep track of all the possible shutdowns or other power faults happening in its network domain.
To run this app you need to install xampp server in your computer and paste all the php scripts which will return JSON formated data on getting requests from the application.
